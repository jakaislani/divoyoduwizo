Her father Kobe Bryant died on helicopter crash on<i> January 26, 2020</i>. Natalia's sister <strong>Gianna Bryant</strong> also met the same fate with their father.</p><p>Born as <strong>Natalia Diamante Bryant </strong>on <i>January 19, 2003</i>, she grew up with her three sisters in Los Angeles. Her sister Gianna was born on <i>May 1, 2006</i>. A decade later on <i>December 5, 2016</i>, Natalia and Gianna welcomed their baby sister<strong> Bianka Bella Bryant</strong>. The youngest of all sisters <strong>Capri Kobe Bryant</strong> was born on <i>June 20, 2019</i>.</p><h2>Natalia Is Currently Single</h2><p><i>17</i>-years old Natalia hasn't revealed her romantic attachments or relationships yet. As a high school student, she seems to devote her time with her family and studies. Unlike most of the celebrity kids, Natalia isn't so active in social medias too.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/7/custom_1581066925665-1581067011782.jpg><p>Although she has to face with medias in the public, Natalia has learned to play it safe. Currently, Natalia attends Sage Hill High School where she plays volleyball with the team <i>Sage Hill Lightning</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kobe's Demise Left Bryant Family Devastated</h2><p>Natalia's dad and baby sister Gianna were among the nine people that were <a href=#>killed in the crash</a>. His loss was felt all around the world. His fans gathered outside the Staples Center in LA and chanted his name to honor Kobe. More to that, Kobe and Gianna's jerseys were displayed allover in the public.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/7/custom_1581064424798-1581064507481.jpg><p>Like Natalia, Gianna had also begun to follow her father's footsteps. She was a budding basketball player and belonged to her school's basketball team <i>Mamba</i>. Furthermore, the <i>Mamba Sports Foundation</i> has set up a fund <i>MambaOnThree Fund </i>to support other victims' families. Bianka and Capri might be naive at the demise of their sister <a href=#>Gianna</a> but Natalia surely has a hard time coping with the loss.</p><h2>Her Parents' Marital Life</h2><p>Natalia's father was just <i>21</i> years old when he met his college sweetheart <a href=#>Vanessa</a> who was three years younger. They had exchanged engagement rings in <i>May, 2000</i>.A year later in<i> April 2001</i>, Kobe and Vanessa finally walked down the aisle at St. Edward the Confessor Catholic Church in Dana Point. Natalia's paternal grandparents were not so glad about Kobe's marriage to Vanessa.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/7/custom_1581066428775-1581066477626.jpg><p>One of the reasons was that she was not African-American and second was that Kobe embraced marriage too early. More to that, Natalia's grandparents and two aunts failed to attend the wedding ceremony. Two years later, Kobe and Vanessa welcomed their first daughter Natalia. Her birth became the sole reason for the couple's reunion with Natalia's grandparents.&nbsp;</p><h2>Natalia's Spoiled Childhood</h2><p>As the baby girl of the legendary basketball player, Natalia's childhood was no different from the life of the richest kids. Her father Kobe had made more than <strong>$680 million</strong>. Besides, the Bryant children lived a luxurious life at their home in New Port. Bryant couple had bought the Mediterranean-style-house for<strong> $4 million</strong> in<i> 2002</i>. 13 years later in <i>May, 2015</i>, Natalia's parents sold the house.</p><p><i><strong>Thousand of Kobe's fans gathered outside Staple Center to mourn his loss:</strong></i></p><figure class=media></figure><p>At six years of age, Natalia and her family moved to a house worth <strong>$9.45 million</strong>.
