In the winter, when I just want to cozy up inside and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>eat carbs</a>, I do mainly indoor exercises like weight lifting. Then, when the weather turns warm and I’m more motivated to get outside and be active, I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>shift to cardio</a>. My philosophy is to build muscle while you’re covered up in the cold months so you can show it off once spring arrives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve definitely changed my approach to fitness as I’ve gotten older. In my 20s I was all about cardio and anything that made me sweat. Now that I’m 37 and have two kids, I’m focused on getting the most out of my workout time. I do lower-impact exercises with higher weights, and I try to maximize each and every rep. I like doing leg presses and weighted squats. These days it’s less about the burpees and sprinting around — my knees can’t always handle that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I exercise when I can. Sometimes I’ll do it seven days in a row; other times it’s only twice a week. I take the opportunity when I have it, knowing that some weeks I won’t be able to exercise as much, because I am not the 5 a.m. workout type. I need my coffee and breakfast first, and then I get my children on their way, so I’m a midmorning-workout person. But I weave fitness into my day. I always take the stairs, which firms your legs, and at home I’ll do lunges as I go from one room to the next. No one is judging you in your own house, so why not make chores active? I turn it into a game, like if I’m picking up my kids’ toys off the floor, I’ll do a squat each time I lower myself down. These little moves keep up my energy, especially on days when I can’t get in a full workout. That’s why Fit52, the health plan featured in my book, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Find Your Path</a>, and in my new fit52 app that I developed with my trainer Eve Overland, takes a week-by-week approach. When you have 52 chances a year to make it a healthy week, you’re less inclined to scold yourself over one bad day. It’s designed to help you stay on track while allowing you some grace.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Dey Street Books</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My two other secrets to looking lean and muscular are, first, I keep my macro numbers — which is your calories, carbs, and protein intake — in check. The second is a good self-tanner or body bronzer. I like Ofra Cosmetics RCK Body Glow, a tinted lotion with a bit of shimmer. If you want your legs to look toned, believe me, a little shimmer goes a long way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Carrie Underwood’s new book, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Find Your Path</a>, and her fit52 app both come out this month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>For more stories like this, pick up the February issue of </i>InStyle<i>, available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> Feb 14.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8KaqauhlWLCr7DEq66op5RixLC%2ByqisrWWWnsF2foybpqij</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./unrated-cut-jason-hell-coming-bluray.html><span>←</span><span>Unrated Cut Of Jason Goes To Hell Coming To Blu-Ray For First Time</span></a>
