Other brands quickly popped up, and by 2018, there wasn't a millennial, rapper, or Instagram influencer who wasn't touting LaCroix's greatness as the next, best "all-natural" alternative to drinking soda, aka the devil's spawn. The flavor-infused water had infiltrated grocery stores, communal office refrigerators, and countless homes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But a 2018 class-action lawsuit disputed the company's allegedly false "all-natural" claims—which the company maintained were true. By early 2020, the plaintiff had dropped the suit, but not before the beverage's popularity waned, and its sales fizzed out.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=1></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">So just what is LaCroix? And is it actually good for you? We spoke with a dietitian and a nutritionist to find out.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-lacroix></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is LaCroix?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The company website describes <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>LaCroix</a> as "naturally-essenced sparkling water" containing "no sweeteners, no calories, and no sodium." But, according to health experts, the company's claims aren't that cut-and-dried.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block">Meet the Expert</p><ul><li>Carolyn Brown, MS, RD, specializes in tailor-made weight management plans. She earned her master's degree in nutrition at NYU and has extensive experience teaching others about quality nutrition.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Serena Poon, CN, CHC, CHN</a>,&nbsp;is&nbsp;a celebrity chef, certified nutritionist, Reiki master, and founder of the method of Culinary Alchemy, which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a combination of education, integrative and functional nutrition, and healing energy.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-lacroix-bad-for-you></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is LaCroix Bad for You?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Let me first jump off my high nutritionist horse and lead with the good: It's absolutely a better option than soda, diet or otherwise," says Brown. "But if you've already cleaned up your diet, are eating veggies and mainly whole foods, [you] pay attention to ingredient labels, and take your health seriously, [there] are a few factors to consider."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chief among them, she says, is the company's definition of<strong> </strong>natural flavoring, the effects of carbonated beverages on appetite, and the amount of<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>bisphenol A</a> (BPA),&nbsp;an industrial chemical used to make certain plastics and resins,<strong> </strong>found inside the cans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Let's break each one of these down.</strong></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Natural Flavoring</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>NICOLE MASON</a> / Stocksy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This is where things can get tricky. Both the concept and the term "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>natural flavors</a>" have always been vague. For her part, Brown steers clear of all foods that list "natural flavors" among their ingredients because they're "often more similar to artificial ingredients and can sometimes include preservatives," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Poon says, "Although historically natural flavorings have been considered a flag, it’s not a black and white conversation. Some natural flavors are in fact derived from plants, others are not. Some natural flavors aren’t great for your health, some are fine. It all depends on how the flavor components are sourced and derived. When buying water with natural flavoring, try to find a bit more information about where the flavors are coming from. If it’s not posted on the label or a company’s website, you can email them and ask."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But, Brown says, there's always a catch. "Even if, for example, a certain grapefruit flavor is extracted directly from grapefruits, companies can still mix in synthetic additives, like solvents, to make that flavor blend well with the other ingredients. The FDA calls these ingredients '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>incidental additives</a>.' And, thanks to a lack of policy governing their use, food makers are not required to disclose what they are or when they're in a product."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bottom line: Companies can claim their flavors are all-natural, even if their compositions are partially synthetic. "Even if there's nothing artificial added, there could still be naturally derived additives that could be harmful if you consume too much of them," adds the narrator. Unfortunately, there's no way to know for sure, due to food companies' (albeit lawful) lack of transparency.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Carbonation</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While Brown acknowledges that consuming fizzy beverages isn't exactly great for your teeth (they contain carbonic acid, which can weaken tooth enamel in a cumulative effect),<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=2></span> she also cites a 2017 study showing that carbon dioxide gas (carbonic acid) increases the release of a hunger hormone called ghrelin.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=3></span> Over one year, male lab rats that&nbsp;drank carbonated beverages, versus those that drank still, ate more and gained more weight, due to elevated levels of ghrelin. One then assumes that a seemingly innocuous LaCroix habit can only make us more ravenous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, Poon says, "Carbonated drinks can be a part of someone’s overall hydration plan. Hydration is a key component of overall health. In my Culinary Alchemy programs, I advise that most people drink their body weight in ounces of water each day (so if you weigh 150 pounds, you would drink 150 ounces of water each day). I do recommend that my clients hydrate primarily with still water, but if someone wants to hydrate with sparkling water every once in a while, that’s okay! As long as your sparkling water does not contain sugar, sodium, or other added ingredients, it should hydrate you just as well as a glass of flat water. One thing to note is that some people do report bloating when they drink sparkling water."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>BPA-Based Plastics</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=10><p><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>TATJANA ZLATKOVIC</a> / Stocksy</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">BPA is a hugely controversial toxic chemical that's often hotly debated among food-safety analysts. It's used to protect foods from contamination, but trace levels leach into&nbsp;the foods themselves.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=4></span> Despite public claims made by many food companies that they no longer use BPA-based plastics in the production of their cans and bottles, there's still no real way for consumers to tell whether the claims are true. This is troubling because consuming even tiny amounts of BPA can put us at risk for some very serious health issues. <span class="mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-sc-block-adslot-inline"></span>BPA exposure is a precursor to thyroid and metabolism problems,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=5></span> fertility problems and irregular periods,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=6></span> adolescent mood swings,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=7></span> and even breast cancer.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=8></span> Although the FDA has since deemed that BPA is safe at the current levels occurring in foods,<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=9></span> LaCroix was once again the subject of a 2019 lawsuit brought by a former employee alleging its parent company's claims of using BPA-free cans were false. Per CBS News, National Beverage Corp. responded to the suit, maintaining that it had already converted to BPA-free cans two years before the suit was filed and citing the FDA's most recent findings.<span class=ql-inline-citation data-cite=10></span></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I advise trying to avoid added chemicals whenever possible. BPA <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>has been found </a>to be an endocrine disruptor and a potential catalyst for cancer," Poon notes. "The dangers of BPA leaching into food via packaging are well known and as such, many manufacturers have switched to BPA-free can linings and plastics."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For what it's worth, says Brown, the state of California includes BPA on its&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Proposition 65&nbsp;list</a> of toxic chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects, or other reproductive harm. And despite the FDA's claim to the contrary, Brown still feels BPA is unsafe and says, "It's not something I agree with." But it's ultimately up to us to make our own assessments.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-healthier-alternatives></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Healthier Alternatives</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I love hydrating with alkaline mountain spring water, when possible. If you’re looking to add some excitement to your hydration, you can add a squeeze of fresh lemon or create an infused water with cucumber or citrus," explains Poon. "People often overlook tea as a flavorful hydration option. As long as tea does not contain caffeine or sugar, it can help you hydrate as well."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're looking for all-natural (and ostensibly healthier) sparkling-water options, Brown also suggests giving these alternatives a try and adding a flavor boost with slices of fresh fruit.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Magnesium-Infused</span></h3><img width=700 height=700 alt="A glass bottle of Topo Chico mineral water." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.byrdie.com/thmb/5ZHzAf-tW8g6nR5rzqE7P0Y24To=/450x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cdn.cliqueinc.com__cache__posts__263722__is-la-croix-healthy-263722-1532451974653-main.700x0c-d6400c55589a4ff49f864d0b66130857.jpg"><p><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__brand>Topo Chico</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__style-name>12oz Mineral Water, 24 Pack</span> <span class=mntl-sc-block-product__prices><span class=mntl-sc-block-product__retail-price>$28.00</span></span></p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow nocaes" id=mntl-sc-block-product__button_1-0 class="mntl-sc-block-product__button mntl-text-link button--dark" data-tracking-container=true><span class=link__wrapper>Shop</span></a><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block beauty-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Topo Chico Mineral Water is chock-full of magnesium, sodium, manganese, potassium, and calcium.
