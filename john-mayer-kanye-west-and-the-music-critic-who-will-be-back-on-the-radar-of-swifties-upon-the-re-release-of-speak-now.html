The latest in the re-releases is her third studio album Speak Now which will be out July 7.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>The album certainly carries some weight, as it includes some less-than-flattering songs about several people that may have dissed 19-year-old Taylor. Though Swift has never confirmed or denied who the fans speculate her songs to be about, here is a list of alleged song subjects that may be back on the radar come July.</p><h2 id=h-camilla-belle data-injectable=false>Camilla Belle</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@katyperry</a> Couldn't have said it better…</p>— Camilla Belle (@CamillaBelle) <a href=#>July 23, 2015</a></figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>Actress Camilla Belle dated Swift’s ex Joe Jonas soon after the pair broke up. This romance seemed to have sparked the song “Better than Revenge” in which Swift says Belle “underestimated just who she was stealing from.”</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Swift received some flack for this song, with many people claiming she was slut-shaming Belle with lines like, “She’s better known for the things that she does on the mattress.”</p><h2 id=h-kanye-west data-injectable=false>Kanye West</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>Taylor Swift’s complicated history with Kanye West can be traced back to a moment when he got up on stage as she was accepting a VMA in 2009 and informed the crowd that Beyonce should’ve won over her. Before he fabricated a phone call and claimed he “made that b**** famous,” Swift seems to have written the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Innocent”</a> about him.</p><p data-characters=248 data-current-count=248 data-injectable=false>The lyrics say, “It’s okay life is a tough crowd/32 and still growing up now/Who you are is not what you did.” Despite her ballad of forgiveness and a brief reconciliation, the pair no longer seem to have an amicable relationship.</p><h2 id=h-bob-lefsetz data-injectable=false>Bob Lefsetz</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=402 data-current-count=402 data-injectable=true>While the song <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Mean”</a> could definitely encompass anyone that doubted or hated Taylor Swift during her career, blogger and music critic Bob Lefsetz is rumored to be the main subject. The writer made a review of her performance at the 2010 Grammys saying she “can’t sing.” A line that made it into the song. “Drunk and grumbling on about how I can’t sing.”</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>Lefsetz even made a response saying that he was “giving Taylor Swift the publicity she deserves” but she “still can’t sing.” Since then, his posts about Swift have been few and far between but do include a grumbling admission that she is, “an iconic performer, possibly the biggest in the world.”</p><h2 id=h-adam-young data-injectable=false>Adam Young</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=305 data-injectable=false>Perhaps one of the most iconic love songs on Speak Now, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Enchanted”</a> is said to be about someone that Taylor only met once. Swift was apparently so taken with meeting Owl City singer Adam Young that she wrote the ballad begging him “Please don’t be in love with someone else.”</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=485 data-injectable=true>As if Swifties needed more confirmation, Young released a response. He uses the singer’s tune to tell her “And I wish you knew/Taylor I was so in love with you.”</p><h2 id=h-taylor-lautner data-injectable=false>Taylor Lautner</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@mrstaylautner href=#>@mrstaylautner</a><p><a title=prayforjohn href=#>#prayforjohn</a></p><a title="♬ Dear John - Taylor Swift" href=#>♬ Dear John – Taylor Swift</a></figure><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>Taylor Lautner on the other hand may be safe from the Swiftie firestorm, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Back to December”</a> relays a breakup that Taylor Swift seems to entirely take the blame for. The pair dated briefly in 2009 after meeting on the set of the film Valentine’s Day.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>Unlike other exes, Lautner seems to be sleeping peacefully with the arrival of Speak Now (Taylor’s Version). He even posted a TikTok to the song “Dear John” under the hashtag #PrayForJohn.</p><h2 id=h-john-mayer data-injectable=false>John Mayer</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true><a title=@holdensmith962 href=#>@holdensmith962</a><p>i cant stop sxrolling through <a title=johnmayer href=#>#johnmayer</a> <a title=taylorswift href=#>#taylorswift</a> <a title=taylorsversion href=#>#taylorsversion</a> <a title=erastour href=#>#erastour</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=speaknowtaylorsversion href=#>#speaknowtaylorsversion</a></p><a title="♬ Dear John - Taylor Swift" href=#>♬ Dear John – Taylor Swift</a></figure><p data-characters=334 data-current-count=334 data-injectable=false>Speaking of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> “Dear John,” </a>John Mayer is likely to receive the majority of the heat during this album’s re-release. So much so that Swift herself had to ask her fans that their “kindness and gentleness extend to [their] internet activities” before she sang the song at night two of her tour in Minneapolis.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayer dated Swift between 2009 and 2010</a> when the songstress was 19 and he was 32. This sparked the power ballad with lines like “Don’t you think nineteen’s too young/to be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?/I should’ve known.”</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>Needless to say, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), is heavy with references, call-outs, and Dear John letters. Fans expect there to be even more celebrity callouts since Taylor released the track list including vault tracks like “When Emma Falls in Love,” which is suspected to be about Emma Stone.</p><p data-characters=62 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>The album releases on July 7 anywhere you can listen to music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S3sLTNZqSasZWneqytzbKcZq%2BVqMFurc2dZK2glWK6tr%2FInGScqpmptqR51qGmZq%2BZoblursRmmZqbm2K8r3nToZxmqpGZrrN5zp9krK%2BZm8GqsdJmrKmnnmLBqbGMq5xmqpWhsqK%2FxGamn2WjpbKit4ynprBn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ufc-mma-news-if-i-decided-to-stay-married-and-my-wife-decides-joe-rogan-sums-up-his-stance-on-marriage-with-an-honest-take-to-matt-walsh-the-joe-rogan-experience.html><span>←</span><span>If I Decided to Stay Married and My Wife Decides Joe Rogan Sums Up HisStance on Marria</span></a>
