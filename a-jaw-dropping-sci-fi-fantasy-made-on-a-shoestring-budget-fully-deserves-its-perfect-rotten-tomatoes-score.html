Completely belying its minimal costs, Ink is an aesthetic tour-de-force that comes across as a much more expensive film than it is, all while the narrative beats prove engaging enough to underline that it isn’t all style without a hint of substance.</p><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=424 data-injectable=false>If you were to build a cult classic from the ground up, then it would look a lot like Ink. It came along without much in the way of fanfare in spite of almost unanimous acclaim, before being largely lost to the sands of time. With any justice, it’ll eventually find the size of audience it deserves, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">because no self-respecting fan of the fantastical </a>should go about their business without having seen it at least once.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGaikax6pb7OqaeippdiwKS1jJ%2BgZp6Ro8Giv9hmpJqclWK8r3nAZqqhp5WowbO1zaBkm62UnLK1ecWuo6WxXZmytLHRr5ysZZmpwG68xKudnpukYr%2BwwNOepWasn6KutbvErGSsm5%2BnsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-ethnicity-is-joey-votto-whats-going-on-with-joey-votto-how-many-years-does-joey-votto-have-left-on-his-contract.html><span>←</span><span>What ethnicity is Joey Votto?
