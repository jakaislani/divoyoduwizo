Meanwhile, it is true most of the time, however, there are a few instances where Rogan shared stories related to his marriage.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>Recently on his podcast, while sitting with a political commentator, Matt Walsh, Rogan talked about marriages.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><span>Joe Rogan and Matt Walsh debate over gay marriage</span></h2><p><span>On episode <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>#1895</a> of his podcast, <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Rogan</a></strong> and Walsh talked about gay marriages and the guest was completely against including gay people in getting married. However, Rogan belonged to a different school of thought. He was in support and said their getting married doesn’t cause harm to anyone.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-twitter-reacts-to-joe-rogan-and-matt-walshs-debate-on-the-latest-jre?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210306120641/GettyImages-473062482-473x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Twitter Reacts to Joe Rogan and Matt Walsh’s Debate on the Latest JRE</p></a><p><span>Rogan said, “So you think by adding gay couples to the definition of that a marriage is by definition it in that way. It’s two people that bond with each other. Somehow harms other people that have successful marriages? That are nuclear family marriages.”</span></p><p><span>Walsh replied that one can’t add them to the definition of marriage, but can only get rid of the definition.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Rogan comes out full-force, 100% in support of gay marriage.

Rogan, while keeping his points, gave an analogy that talked about his marriage.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Rogan explained why his marriage wasn’t affected by anyone else getting married</h2><p><span>The UFC commentator said, “I don’t think gay people being married had any affect on whether straight people stay together. Or whether or not straight people get married. Or whether or not straight people appreciate marriage.”</span></p><p><span>Talking about his marriage, the podcaster said, “I don’t think my marriage is affected at all by my friend getting divorced. I don’t think it has any effect on me.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20210306120641/GettyImages-473062482-473x315.jpg><p>Citing the example of Elizabeth Taylor, he said, “If I decided to stay married and my wife decides to stay married to me, that’s our own decision… two other people getting married or not getting married. Or Elizabeth Taylor getting married 10 times means nothing.”</p><p><span>Rogan explained his statement by saying it’s his and his wife’s decision whether they want to stay married. Furthermore, they are together because of their commitment to raising a family.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span>What do you think about Rogan’s statement?
