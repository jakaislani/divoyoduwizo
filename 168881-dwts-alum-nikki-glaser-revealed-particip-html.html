She started off by complaining about being voted off first.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>"It's like being on 'The Bachelor.'"</strong></h3><p class=Fg>The comedienne <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/08/26/dancing-with-the-stars-alum-nikki-glaser-dishes-behind-the-scenes-hookups/>described the moment</a> as "truly one of the worst moments of my entire life." She explained that she took the elimination hard because she’d taken the show "so seriously."</p><p class=Fg>The talk show’s host then asked Glaser to share some secrets that fans of the dance competition might not know, and she <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/08/26/dancing-with-the-stars-alum-nikki-glaser-dishes-behind-the-scenes-hookups/>responded</a>: "Everyone's [expletive] each other." The comedienne had been paired with professional dancer Gleb Savchenko during her participation.</p><p class=Fg>While Spade was a bit surprised by the revelation Glaser <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/08/26/dancing-with-the-stars-alum-nikki-glaser-dishes-behind-the-scenes-hookups/>added</a>: "Everyone. I mean it always comes out, one couple fell in love. ... It's multiply that, it's more than that." During her season model, Alexis Ren and her professional partner Alan Bersten were said to have bonded in a deeper way than just an ordinary friendship.</p><p class=Fg>However, the pair never took their relationship beyond the dance show. Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev also began seeing each other after their season had come to an end.</p><p class=Fg>Their relationship flourished officially after Bella’s engagement to John Cena ended. Glaser, however, implied that more cast members hooked up than what people got to see.</p><p class=Fg>She explained how the hookups occurred <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://popculture.com/reality-tv/2019/08/26/dancing-with-the-stars-alum-nikki-glaser-dishes-behind-the-scenes-hookups/>saying</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It is real, it's like being on 'The Bachelor,' like it is so intense.
