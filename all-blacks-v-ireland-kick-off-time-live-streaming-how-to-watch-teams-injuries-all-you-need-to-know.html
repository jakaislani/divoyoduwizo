All Blacks v Ireland, the opening test in a three-match tour. Kicking off at 7.05pm, at Eden Park.
What's at stake?
The All Blacks are likely to meet either Ireland or South Africa (who they face in two tests straight after this series) in the quarter-finals of the Rugby World Cup next year. So, there will be many tea leaves to sift after this series.

Lose one, and we'll shift nervously in our seats. Lose the series and it's back to nationwide lockdowns and 1pm briefings.</p><p><strong>So, is this one of those half-baked teams the Northern Hemisphere nations send out here that we spank by 50 points?</strong></p><p>Nope. Ireland are a real-deal team — and tonight's first test is their best chance to break down another barrier, beating the All Blacks at home. They will be greatly added by the fact the All Blacks are often scratchy in their first test of the year.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But the length of the tour should catch them out by the time they roll into Wellington for the third test on 16 July. Some players will have to double up between midweek matches against the Māori All Blacks and the Saturday tests — there are three on the bench tonight (Conor Murray, Joey Carberry and Bundee Aki) who featured in Wednesday's defeat to the Māori.</p><p>For the Irish, tonight's the night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/JAFShsCKtL6ZylV_e5K2SuTa8ek=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/S55DQKSX33EXLE6EWDSBD7BMFY.png"><p><strong>Also at stake:</strong></p><p>There's the much discussed matter of the <a href=#>All Blacks Never Ever Losing At Eden Park</a>. The last time the national side lost was in 1994, when Wet Wet Wet's "Love Is All Around" was top of the charts and a bright-eyed, skinny kid called Ian Foster was playing first five-eighths for Waikato.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-sport">Related articles</h2><p><strong>Ireland's form:</strong></p><p>In March, the Irish beat England 32-15 at Twickenham, finishing second in the competition courtesy of an earlier 30-24 defeat to eventual winners France in Paris.</p><p>They've won three of the past five matches between these two sides, never having claimed an All Black scalp prior to 2016. Ten of the starting line-up named by coach Andy Farrell were in the team that won in Dublin last November. These blokes know what's required to beat the All Blacks, and they know how to smash through hoodoos.</p><p><strong>All Blacks' recent form:</strong></p><p>Let's just try to stay upbeat, shall we?</p><p><strong>Who's the ref?</strong></p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>Englishman Karl Dickson is the referee. He swung the whistle in November's match between the All Blacks and Italy in Rome — a game which ZB rugby caller Elliott Smith has labelled as <a href=#>"one of the worst spectacles of recent rugby memory"</a>... and he's seen <a href=#>Josh Kronfeld perform a paso doble</a> on Dancing with the Stars.</p><p>Dickson has a side-hustle; he's part of Out Of The Scrum, a rugby coaching business which shares handy drills on <a href=#>their Facebook page</a>, including a breakdown practice that looks like a more brutal version of Duck Duck Goose. In a similar vein, he used to blog on parenting issues at <a href=#>the Baba website</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/mwRfBRu6VzreZnobTyJX5qP8xOw=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/LPLE2LGGGJTVNF3WKFIEXLWJWY.jpg"><p><strong>So, the ref will treat the players like babies?</strong></p><p>More like sulky teens. He was reffing a match that involved his former Harlequin teammate Kyle Sinkler last year when the Lions prop eyeballed him and bellowed: "Are you f****** serious."</p><p>Sinkler did not get sent to his room.</p><p><strong>Has the ref revealed any insights into his philosophy?</strong></p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"Never stand directly in front of a baby when you change them, always stand to the side."</p><p><strong>The sick list</strong></p><p>Losing a few big names to injury and illness is nothing new, but the All Blacks' list is notable: David Havili, Jack Goodhue, Will Jordan, Joe Moody, Anton Lienert-Brown, Akira Ioane and Ethan Blackadder are all out.

In Ireland's recent successes against the All Blacks, containing Barrett has been key — and the tourists will have recognised and appreciated the way the Crusaders shut down the No 10 in the Super Rugby final.
