<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Crash movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2005)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I make this sound almost like episodic TV, but Haggis writes with such directness and such a good ear for everyday speech that the characters seem real and plausible after only a few words. His cast is uniformly strong; the actors sidestep cliches and make their characters particular.</p><p>For me, the strongest performance is by Matt Dillon, as the racist cop in anguish over his father. He makes an unnecessary traffic stop when he thinks he sees the black TV director and his light-skinned wife doing something they really shouldn't be doing at the same time they're driving. True enough, but he wouldn't have stopped a black couple or a white couple. He humiliates the woman with an invasive body search, while her husband is forced to stand by powerless, because the cops have the guns -- Dillon, and also an unseasoned rookie (<a href=#>Ryan Phillippe</a>), who hates what he's seeing but has to back up his partner.</p><p>That traffic stop shows Dillon's cop as vile and hateful. But later we see him trying to care for his sick father, and we understand why he explodes at the HMO worker (whose race is only an excuse for his anger). He victimizes others by exercising his power, and is impotent when it comes to helping his father. Then the plot turns ironically on itself, and both of the cops find themselves, in very different ways, saving the lives of the very same TV director and his wife. Is this just manipulative storytelling? It didn't feel that way to me, because it serves a deeper purpose than mere irony: Haggis is telling parables, in which the characters learn the lessons they have earned by their behavior.</p><p>Other cross-cutting Los Angeles stories come to mind, especially Lawrence Kasdan's more optimistic "<a href=#>Grand Canyon</a>" and Robert Altman's more humanistic "<a href=#>Short Cuts</a>." But "Crash" finds a way of its own. It shows the way we all leap to conclusions based on race -- yes, all of us, of all races, and however fair-minded we may try to be -- and we pay a price for that. If there is hope in the story, it comes because as the characters crash into one another, they learn things, mostly about themselves. Almost all of them are still alive at the end, and are better people because of what has happened to them. Not happier, not calmer, not even wiser, but better. Then there are those few who kill or get killed; racism has tragedy built in.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46cqZqrmGJ%2FcXyU</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roscoe-dash-age-wikipedia-biography-height-weight-net-worth-in-2021-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Roscoe Dash Age, Wikipedia, Biography, Height, Weight, Net Worth and more</span></a>
