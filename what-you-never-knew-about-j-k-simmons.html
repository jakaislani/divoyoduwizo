He shortened his name to "J.K." before launching his film career, per <a href=#>The Guardian</a>. In high school, he sported long blonde hair and played JV football. At John Worthington High, you had three choices – be a jock, a nerd, or "a weird hippie freak. You cannot cross these lines," he explained. After ending up on a team with the motto, "It's gotta hurt!," he was sorry he did.</p><p dir=ltr>In 2015, he told <a href=#>Esquire</a> his abusive coaches made his life a living hell, screaming at players and denying them water. "I literally got kicked in the a** repeatedly and called all kinds of names," he said. So, the young athlete traded in his cleats and team jersey for sandals and tie-dyed t-shirts. "I went from being a jock to a hippie," he said. "Quickly, I was back in the pine trees with the hippies, listening to my Jimi Hendrix and my Janis Joplin and turning on, tuning in and dropping out."</p><p dir=ltr>But there's more to this story. He questioned if being a football player was worth his time, since he thought the hippie girls were prettier than the jock girls. He also was diagnosed with <a href=#>Osgood-Schlatter disease</a>, a common affliction in adolescents, which causes knee pain. That, unfortunately, put an end to his football career once and for all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXBmbH96e9ahmK1lqaTCbrrEr5yrZZujsrh5wJumrqxdn3qsedKipKannqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-added-sugar-mean.html><span>←</span><span>What does added sugar mean</span></a>
