I was in high school when it came out and it was one of the first movies that felt like a capital ‘F’ Film. Diane Kruger was incredible in it, and she’s held a special place in my heart ever since. Kruger has somewhat rescinded from the limelight in recent years, so I was thrilled to see her pop up in an episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Harper Bazaar UK’s What’s in My Bag series</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the items that stood out to me was the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector</a> from Laura Mercier, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Sarah Jessica Parker-used brand</a>. The tinted moisturizer offers a sheer tint that still impacts a noticeable difference in the skin. (Plus, there’s the always-appreciated bonus of sun protection, courtesy of SPF 30.) In the video, the actress called it her “go-to everyday tint,” adding that it looks “natural” and “feels fresh all day.”&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Being a tinted moisturizer, it (obviously) already has some hydrating skincare properties courtesy of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin E</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>macadamia oil</a>. But it has some other attention-worthy active ingredients, too; namely <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>vitamin C</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>tamarind</a>. The former provides brightening, wrinkle-reduction, and texture-smoothing benefits, while the latter, though lesser-known in the skincare world, is antioxidant-rich, elasticity-improving, roughness-reducing, and moisture-retaining. The bottom line is that your skin will get the immediate skin-enhancing benefits of a cosmetic product with the long-term benefits of a moisturizer or serum.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A reviewer on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Laura Mercier site</a> called it a “game changer… for anyone with mature skin.” Another shopper said this is the “best no-makeup [product] you can find.” A third shopper said the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector</a> gives them a “soft, luminous finish” and “doesn’t flake or settle into fine lines and wrinkles.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There is one caveat that I should highlight, however: If you were a fan of the original tinted moisturizer, do not simply buy the shade you were using before it was reformulated. Many shoppers say that the shade range has changed slightly and you will likely need to reassess yours.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That being said, head to Nordstrom to shop the now-$46 <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer Natural Skin Perfector</a> while it’s on sale for a limited time.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6KYp51doL%2B2s8SrZKWZpaeubrnEq5qinaJiwaq6056bZqWfnsC1wdGisZ6qXW2Dc4CRa2k%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobby-genovese-net-worth-278169.html><span>←</span><span>Bobby Genovese Net Worth 2024</span></a>
