<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch movie review (2011)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Flashbacks reveal how a young lad was adopted by Nerio Winch from a Croatian orphanage and raised in hiding by a kindly couple against that day when Nerio might require an heir. Why Croatia? Because this is one of those movies that's always helping you with subtitles saying "Croatia," "Hong Kong" and "<a href=#>Brazil</a>." The death of Nerio, explained as an accident, sets off a boardroom struggle for control of Winch International.</p><p>The firm's acting head of is Ann Ferguson (<a href=#>Kristin Scott Thomas</a>), who is one of the most visible actresses in the movies right now; she has made eight movies since this one, with five more in production. Her perfect French and crisp composure allow her to fit in Gallic romantic intrigues, historical roles and even a thriller like this, in which she stares down a boardroom of tough executives.</p><p>She knows of the existence of young Largo, who she produces from thin air with the aplomb of a magician holding up a wriggling rabbit. Not everyone is delighted that Largo exists, including the firm's security officer (<a href=#>Steven Waddington</a>) and vice president (<a href=#>Benedict Wong</a>). It's also a good question whether Ann Ferguson herself is delighted. The plot thickens with the appearance of a second heir apparent, who I dare not describe, because that would spoil a very tiny secret.</p><p>Much interest is added by the beautiful Lea (<a href=#>Melanie Thierry</a>, reminding me of <a href=#>Maud Adams</a>). She is either Largo's lover or his enemy, or both. Their contest involves complex financial instruments, and indeed I began to fear the whole movie would play out right there in the boardroom until the day was saved by a fight to the death high atop, yes, the Hong Kong skyscraper.</p><p>Do you sometimes get the feeling that you haven't seen a film before, but you might as well have? All of the ingredients are basic. You need a male lead with a permanent short stubble. A sensual woman who seems pretty young to be playing with grizzled veterans. Flashbacks to inexplicable locations that may have something do with production deals and tax shelters. An older, ruthless figure (gender optional) who is a puppetmaster. A giant sinister corporation that plays the role formerly assigned in thrillers to Russia or China. And of course the rooftop struggle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lmJq2s3nAqaeaqpWjwW64wKueqGWnnruktIxrZ2pp</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./slow-cooker-queso-blanco.html><span>←</span><span>Slow Cooker Queso Blanco - Mom On Timeout</span></a>
