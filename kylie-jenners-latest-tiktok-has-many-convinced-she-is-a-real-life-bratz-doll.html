In it, the pair were spotted having a filter on which gave them bigger lips and some blushed cheeks.</p><p>The two seemed to enjoy the song as they posed in front of the camera. However, people were quick to comment that the filters made Kylie look like a real-life Bratz doll.</p><p>One user wrote: “It took me a LOOOONG minute but Kylie low-key be looking like a Bratz Doll.” Others seemed to agree as one wrote: “high key.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=stacey-and-kylie-have-made-tiktoks-in-the-past>Stacey and Kylie have made TikToks in the past</h2><p>This is not the first time Stacey and Kylie have come together to make a video.

Fans love the mother-daughter duo and have been wanting more of them on the platform.</p><p>Recently, Kylie and Stormi even had a nail spa day which had everyone calling her “best mom ever.” Their short clips together definitely send the internet wild and we will be lying if we said we didn’t want more of it.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU FROM THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 2ND<br><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">INSTAGRAM</a>&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FACEBOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfmLKtscGroK2xXaOyuL%2BOpLCloZVit6a6zZ6prGWclsGmv9Nmq6KjpKS4brTArGSmmZ6ueqS7za%2Bgp5uVmXq0tMRmoKxlkWK%2Fpq3LZqOinpVir7Ot07NknaecoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./liberal-arts-2012.html><span>←</span><span>Liberal Arts movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2012)</span></a>
