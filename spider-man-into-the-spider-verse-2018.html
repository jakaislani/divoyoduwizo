<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse movie review (2018)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>At their center is Miles Morales (voiced with heart and smarts by “<a href=#>Dope</a>” star <a href=#>Shameik Moore</a>), an ordinary Brooklyn teenager who undergoes an extraordinary transformation when he gets bitten by a radioactive spider. The streets and brownstones, cabs and subways of his daily life have a detailed, tactile realism about them, but also the heightened aesthetic of a comic book come to life, complete with panels and dialogue bubbles. It’s simply gorgeous.</p><p>As was the case with his Queens counterpart, Peter B. Parker (<a href=#>Jake Johnson</a>), the newfound powers Miles discovers are simultaneously terrifying and exhilarating. These characters, and the various others we meet in the Spider-Verse, introduce themselves in cheeky fashion, going through the familiar steps of their own respective spider bites in playful, knowing ways. The high-energy repetition of this well-worn origin story, in all its wild permutations, is a consistent source of laughs.</p><p>Whereas Miles is young, eager and full of promise, the version of Peter Parker he eventually encounters is middle-aged, jaded and paunchy. It’s an inspired new angle into this iconic superhero, and Johnson finds just the right combination of sarcasm and sadness in his reluctant mentor figure.</p><p>But wait, there’s more—so much more. Because Miles and Peter aren’t the only Spider-men out there. When megalomaniacal crime lord Wilson Fisk (<a href=#>Liev Schreiber</a>) builds a super collider that tears a hole in the time-space continuum—or something—various Spider-beings from other dimensions come tumbling out. They include the elegant and acrobatic Gwen Stacy/Spider-Woman (<a href=#>Hailee Steinfeld</a>), who poses as a student at Miles’ school; <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a>’s Spider-Noir, a black-and-white, hard-boiled detective; the anime-inspired Penni Parker (<a href=#>Kimiko Glenn</a>), who fights crime with the help of her friendly robot; and the aforementioned Peter Porker, a.k.a. Spider-Ham (a perfectly cast <a href=#>John Mulaney</a>), who steals his every scene.</p><p>Previously, we’d already met another more traditional Spider-Man within Miles’ timeline, voiced by <a href=#>Chris Pine</a>. And among the other characters we’re familiar with, we see Peter’s longtime love, Mary Jane (<a href=#>Zoe Kravitz</a>); his reliable Aunt May (<a href=#>Lily Tomlin</a>); and legendary nemeses including Doc Ock (<a href=#>Kathryn Hahn</a>, in a great bit of gender-bending casting). The always-excellent <a href=#>Brian Tyree Henry</a> and <a href=#>Mahershala Ali</a> respectively portray Miles’ father and uncle: two very different figures who have had an enormous influence on the intelligent, resourceful young man Miles has become. Luna <a href=#>Lauren Velez</a> voices his warmly supportive mom, Rio.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sp6Kclad6rq3NZqCnrJ9iwamxjKynopyVp3q3sdGsnGZqYGaF</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./95161-jessa-duggar-shares-photos-beloved-boys-html.html><span>←</span><span>Jessa Duggar shares photos of her two beloved little boys</span></a>
