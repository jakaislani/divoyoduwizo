While "Killers of the Flower Moon" probably rates as one of the director's talkiest films, it is also one of his most purely gorgeous, with two stunning shots of DiCaprio and windows in particular‚Äîone with flames, one with him peering back at Mollie through imperfectly transparent glass‚Äîthat had me catching my breath.
