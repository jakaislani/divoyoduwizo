One song in particular, titled “Clara Bow,” immediately caught fans’ attention since it’s a direct reference to the iconic American silent film era actor and because the musician has seemingly referenced her in the past during the promotion of her Midnights album."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

We were shocked and then the intrigue set in because no one from our family has been contacted or knew about this prior. We found out via the Instagram post like everybody else,” Sisneros revealed.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Dive Deeper</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“[I] took my oldest daughter to the [Eras Tour] concert,” she added. “When we told her [about the new ‘Clara Bow’ song] she was excited and looking forward to telling her little friends.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Born in New York City in 1905, Bow found her way to movie stardom as a teenager in a beauty contest. She first appeared in the 1922 film Down to the Sea in Ships then moved to Hollywood, becoming a huge sex symbol through her roles in Black Oxen (1923), Wine (1924), It (1927), and Wings (1927), among others. Offscreen, her love life was scrutinized and her mental health unraveled, forcing her into early retirement at age 28. She spent the rest of her life largely out of the spotlight with her husband of 31 years, actor-turned-politician Rex Bell, and their two sons on the family ranch in southern Nevada.</p><img alt="clara bow poses for a photo with her head lying on her hands, she wears a watch, and an outfit with feathers and tulle" title="Clara Bow, circa 1928" width=3594 height=2838 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/s-hollywood-film-star-clara-bow-news-photo-1707946150.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Clara Bow, circa 1928</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the exact vibe of “Clara Bow” will remain a secret until the album debuts, both Sisneros and Bell hope it will capture the “perseverance” of their late great-grandmother. “I hope she conveys a positive image of Clara Bow, which I think she will,” Bell mused. “I would imagine that Taylor uses this as a way to highlight her accomplishments, her accolades, her talent. They’re both people that have really strong raw talent.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bow’s great-granddaughters also noted how Swift is a modern-day “It girl”—a title Bow was the first to hold following her starring role in the 1927 movie It. “I think the Eras Tour solidifies that,” Sisneros said. “Truly, that one performer can carry such a load and perform at such <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/a46063547/taylor-swift-sings-setlist-on-treadmill/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a grueling pace" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">a grueling pace</a>. And night after night, these three, four-hour shows with 40 odd songs on a set list that has hundreds of thousands of people captivated truly shows her place in this industry.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">All About Taylor Swift</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think Clara Bow would feel the same kinship and protectiveness over someone who’s of the same level of fame as her in dealing with the media and how heavy the crown is to carry,” Bell added.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Get the Look</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/9a567d86-724b-41b0-af8c-693ccd347ed1_1647958814.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Gretty Garcia" title="Headshot of Gretty Garcia" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Gretty Garcia is the associate news editor at Cosmopolitan, where she covers all things news, entertainment, and pop culture.
