Using Dawn Dish Soap to get rid of ants is a simple process. Spray a solution of water and Dawn straight onto counters, floors, sinks, or any other area where ants seem to be congregating to get rid of them. A spray of dawn on an ant will pierce their exoskeleton and kill them on contact if the solution is applied directly to them. This method is also effective against wasps and cockroaches."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
