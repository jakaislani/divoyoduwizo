Judge shared the news on a now-deleted Instagram story that same day with a screenshot of a text message from Barney alerting her mother about what was going on with the caption, “the text no parent wants to get.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=569 data-current-count=569 data-injectable=true>Some of the messages included Barney telling Judge that she and her classmates were unaware of why they were placed on lockdown and that they could hear police sirens as they hid in a classroom. In addition to the image, the 55-year-old tearfully opened up about the ordeal in another now-removed Instagram story. Judge expressed how helpless she felt receiving the texts and being unable to protect her daughter. She also disclosed that the event had caused Barney not to want to “go back to school” despite it being her senior year. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reality star</a> said,</p><p>“You get the text, and you’re so helpless. There’s nothing you can do in this f—ing world. I’m so sick of it. I’m so sick of what’s going on. My daughter now doesn’t want to go back to school. It’s her senior year… It’s got to stop!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Screenshot-2023-04-13-at-8.33.46-PM.png><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Later in the clip, Judge confirmed that Barney and everyone were left unharmed, but the experience alone left students and teachers traumatized. The mother of four stated that the unnamed man was captured while describing the agony that everyone went through during that moment,</p><p>“Everything’s okay, and they caught the guy. But there was somebody that came into my daughter’s school today, and they put them in lockdown. He did have a weapon. The kids are traumatized, the teachers are traumatized. They had the students barricade the door with bookshelves, they were laying on the floor. One teacher handed out hammers, another one had a fire extinguisher, ready to go after somebody. Kids were crying, ‘I don’t want to die.'”</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>In a statement released to People, a representative for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department reiterated Judge’s remarks about the unidentified man being apprehended. The person added that the man “was detained quickly” after he entered the school and informed a security guard that he had a weapon, which <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">turned out to be a pocket knife.</a></p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>After the admission, it’s reported the security guard followed the man “because of his behavior.” This action would ultimately lead to the man being arrested and charged with trespassing.</p><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=70 data-injectable=false>At this time, no additional details have been provided to the public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S%2Fpq3LZp%2BoraOaxKrCxKxkrKyRp3q1rcyrmGaipZm0pnnSoZirnaNiwaa%2B0aKdsqGenHq0wM6rsGaZo2Kur3nAq6SenF2irq950p6lnatdnbKzecOarKCgpJq%2FtHnSnJ%2Bop5xitq%2FAzmajqJubmby4uo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./intel-previews-m2-optane-ssd-905p-380gb.html><span>←</span><span>Intel Previews M.2 Optane SSD 905P 380GB</span></a>
