Sunscreen, after all, is your first line of protection against getting skin cancer. But what about putting <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF on your scalp</a>? How necessary is it to have sun protection on an area that can be covered by hair or a hat?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's an often-forgotten area, the truth is that your scalp is still skin, and you need to pay the same attention as you would any part of your body — especially when it comes to sun exposure. But don't just take our word for it. To settle the debate of whether you actually need SPF on your scalp or not, we turned to the experts. See what they had to say below.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-you-need-spf-on-your-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do You Need SPF on Your Scalp?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The short answer to this is yes, you need <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>SPF on your scalp</a>. "You&nbsp;should absolutely be applying&nbsp;SPF&nbsp;to your&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;will be in the sun for an extended time period; often more than 15 minutes can start causing a sunburn in many people," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Christine Shaver</a>, MD, board-certified dermatologist at Bernstein Medical Center for Hair Restoration in New York City. "The&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;skin needs to be protected just like the skin on any other body region. Hair is not sufficient protection from the sun’s harmful rays."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All horizontal body surfaces ([areas that are]perpendicular&nbsp;to the rays of the sun) receive a particularly strong dose of sun exposure, and&nbsp;scalps are a very common site of sunburn, sun damage, and sun-related skin cancers," adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Hadley King</a>, MD, a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-happens-when-you-dont-use-spf-on-your-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Happens When You Don't Use SPF on Your Scalp?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shaver explains that the scalp is just as likely as any part of our body to get sunburned. Because it often gets overlooked due to the presence of hair, some skin cancers on the scalp can go undetected. "Since hair often hides the ability for many people to clearly see their&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;and monitor for new moles or scabbing areas, sometimes skin cancers that appear on the&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;can go unnoticed for a long period of time," she says. "This means changing lesions may be diagnosed at a later stage when they are bigger and more advanced. You should use the help of your local board-certified dermatologist to carefully examine and monitor for any changing spots on your&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;since it can be quite difficult to do on your own."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. King explains that the thinner the hair, the higher the risk you'll have of burning and to pay special attention to where you part your hair as that is also a high-risk area for developing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin cancer</a>. Dr. Shaver adds that frequent sun exposure can slowly cause the quality of the scalp to change and lead to decreased blood flow and hair thinning. The best way to avoid all these is to wear a hat when outside or use SPF on your scalp.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-put-spf-on-your-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Put SPF on Your Scalp?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're worried about the mess of liquid sunscreen getting on your scalp, don't worry. Both Dr. Shaver and Dr. King say powder and spray formulations are your best bet here. "Powder and spray formulations are easy to apply," says Dr. King. "I particularly like powder formulations for the scalp because they don't leave the hair greasy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recommends using something like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Brush On Block Mineral Powder Sunscreen</a>, which she loves because it's easy to apply, portable, and won't leave residue on your hair. She also likes <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>ColoreScience's Total Protection Sheer Matte&nbsp;SPF&nbsp;30&nbsp;Sunscreen&nbsp;Brush</a>. If you have a bald scalp, she says to use <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Isdin's&nbsp;Eryfotona&nbsp;Actinica</a>, which she says gives you SPF 50 protection and has DNA repair enzymes to address previous sun damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For application, Dr. Shaver says to focus on areas with the least amount of coverage, like the hairline, where you normally part your hair, or the crown. If you have a shaved or bald head, be sure to cover all the areas of potential sun exposure.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shaver also says to employ the help of your hairstylist and dermatologist to help catch any suspicious moles or changes on the scalp for your skin. "Hairdressers can be helpful to keep a close eye on the&nbsp;scalp&nbsp;in times between dermatologist visits and can help alert someone about a new or changing lesion," she says. "See the dermatologist for evaluation and possibly a biopsy."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qmdZp6fp3q6u9SrZKybkaG9brHXqaOaoZ6av26DknBpb3Bl</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cufboys-net-worth-300897.html><span>←</span><span>CUFBOYS Net Worth</span></a>
