In a lengthy post, he expressed his relentless efforts to find Carlee.&nbsp;</p><p>He stated, <strong>“I have been going nonstop since I received the call that she was missing on Thursday night. I know she would’ve done the same for me, so I wasn’t going to give up until I saw her face again!”</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Thomar faced discouragement from false allegations and assumptions about his involvement in her abduction but remained steadfast in his faith.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Carlee Russell Boyfriend?</h2><p>Thomar Latrell Simmons, originally from Hoover, Alabama, graduated from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, as he shared in a December 2022 Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><p>His caption read, <strong>“Let your dreams be bigger than your fears, your actions louder than your words, and your faith stronger than your feelings.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The disturbing sighting</h2><p>On Thursday at around 9:30 p.m., Carlee Russell was driving home after picking up dinner. During her journey, she noticed a young boy walking along the side of I-459 in a diaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Concerned for the child’s safety, she immediately called 911 to report the situation.</p><p>Following the call to 911, Carlee reached out to her brother’s girlfriend while she approached the child to inquire about his well-being.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the girlfriend couldn’t hear the child respond. Instead, all she heard was Carlee’s scream before losing contact with her.&nbsp;</p><p>The background noise suggested that Carlee was still near the highway.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The mysterious disappearance</h2><p>Law enforcement was alerted promptly and rushed to the scene within three minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>They found Carlee’s car door open, the engine running, and her phone, hat, and wig lying on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>These unusual circumstances left everyone puzzled, and soon after, local, state, and federal agencies joined the search for Carlee, employing drones and traffic video footage to aid their efforts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The safe return</h2><p>Then, just before 11 p.m. on Saturday, the Russell family received a call from Carlee. She had returned home on foot, alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The Hoover Fire Department quickly transported her to UAB Hospital for evaluation, and she was later released after receiving treatment.</p><p>Carlee Russell boyfriend, Thomar Latrell Simmons, remained dedicated to locating her and provided valuable insights into the ordeal during her absence.</p><p>Carlee’s family is of the belief that she was abducted. In a <a href=#>tweet</a>, according to her mother, Talita Robinson-Russell provided her statement to the detectives, allowing them to investigate the individual responsible for Carlee’s disappearance further.</p><p>In a <a href=#>Facebook</a> post, Carlee’s mother, Talitha Robinson-Russell, expressed relief and gratitude for her daughter’s safe return.&nbsp;</p><p>The family thanked supporters for their compassion and generosity during this trying time.&nbsp;</p><p>Talitha also emphasized the exhaustion the family endured throughout the ordeal and requested privacy to allow them to focus on their daughter’s recovery and spend quality time with close family and friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Thomas Plea for Respect and Understanding</h2><p>Carlee Russell’s boyfriend, Thomar Latrell Simmons, vehemently denied any involvement in her mysterious disappearance.</p><p>Thomar Latrell Simmons, Carlee Russell boyfriend, took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to address the situation and requested respect for her condition.&nbsp;</p><p>He stated that she had been fighting for her life during the 48-hour period of her disappearance, making it difficult for her to provide any updates on her kidnapper.&nbsp;</p><p>The post aimed to clarify the situation and discourage unfounded speculations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The ongoing Investigation</h2><p>As the case unfolds, law enforcement remains tight-lipped about the investigation.</p><p>&nbsp;The police emphasized their commitment to releasing factual and pertinent information to the public as they continued to investigate Carlee Russell’s disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>It remains unclear if Thomar’s claims came directly from Carlee, her family, or official sources.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>No Reports of Missing Child</h2><p>Intriguingly, police received no reports of a missing child during the same period Carlee reported seeing the toddler walking along the interstate.&nbsp;</p><p>The lack of additional information and the mysterious circumstances surrounding her disappearance has only deepened the intrigue surrounding the case.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvwKujnp1dp8K0v8Slo2aan66zs7XEp5to</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tatjana-patitz-siblings-meet-sophie-patitz.html><span>←</span><span>Tatjana Patitz siblings: Meet Sophie Patitz</span></a>
