Interviews Madeline Stowe, a critic at heart Roger Ebert &nbsp;|&nbsp; 1994-01-16 LOS ANGELES -- Well, of course I like Madeleine Stowe. When she was in college, she wanted to be a film critic.

The word "love" may not get re-calibrated for addiction, but it gets modified. We speak of "tough love."
