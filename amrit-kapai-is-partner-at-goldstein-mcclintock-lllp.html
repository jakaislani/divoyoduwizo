The reality show got green-lighted in 2020, where they decoded the chronicles of several Indian-American families that entered Miami, Florida, showing the history of three generations of immigrants.</p><p>Kapai is one of the main men as he carries the lighthearted and comedic docuseries. With the backing of Truly Original, the Emmy-winning production company, they were destined to succeed.</p><p>After instances of drama, marriage, and fights, the vibrant families as still as tight-knit as ever, with the parents trying to hold on to their cherished customs while the young adults struggle to live at home until marriage.</p><p>Indeed, youngsters have tendencies to bottle their feeling until they explode like a volcano, leaving a wave of disrespect and disappointed elderly in their wake.</p><p>The constant push and pull come with fiction but also brings funny family dynamics that are laugh-out-loud worthy. Joining Amrit are his peers Bali Chainani, Monica Vaswani, Brian Benni, and many more as they found arranged friendships.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-amrit-kapai-age-has-crossed-intro-the-30s></span>1. Amrit Kapai Age Has Crossed Intro The 30s<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amrit Kapai is 35 years old.

The institution taught him many life lessons and sent him to oversee the Fudan University, Shanghai, China, for an exchange program.</p><p>Despite Florida being his native land, he held a place in his heart for Chicago as the change in weather was visually pleasing. He first came across the city when he was still seventeen years old. Indeed, he and his friend made a field trip to the magical city for a spiritual retreat. The metropolis was the perfect place to reinvent himself, and he found his calling.</p><p>After graduation, it was only plausible to return to the town as he packed his suitcases and never looked back. The winds were oddly comforting as the independent way of living alone made him feel confident in himself.</p><p>The minor chores of laundry, cooking, and groceries were vastly different back home as he learned to become an adult.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-amrit-kapai-parents-suresh-and-lavina-kapai-are-fan-favorites></span>2. Amrit Kapai Parents Suresh and Lavina Kapai Are Fan Favorites<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Amrit Kapai&nbsp;parents are&nbsp;Suresh and Lavina Kapai. The family moved to the US from India.</p><p>First-generation immigrant adults remain receptive to their interests and are certainly one of the most open-minded parents in the reality TV realm.</p><p>His dad traveled from the Indian subcontinent with no more than ten dollars in his pocket and a broken understanding of the language.</p><p>In a few decades, he had made himself a self-made man with a career and a family.</p><p>But the viewers showered their love for other reasons as they graciously tackled the news of having a homosexual son despite being for the Indian community.</p><p>Initially, the pair were far from happy after their son came out to them around five years ago.</p><p>Eventually, they gathered their wits and unlocked their arms to welcome their child back into their lives. Watchers native to the land remained shellshocked by their sincerity and genuine effort for Amrit.</p><p>They applauded their reactions, saying their community could have avoided future trauma in only parents were like them.</p><p>Meanwhile, the couple had other worries eating them alive. The outside world was not so forgiving when people married outside their culture, let alone a man, as they warned him not to reveal his spectrum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-amrit-kapai-grandma-passed-away-last-year></span>3.

She was a force of nature, raising four children and six grandchildren under her wing.</p><p>Despite having to relive the moment after the series aired on television, he did not feel sad, as he was thankful that people got to meet her and remain forever alive in their memories.</p><p>In the celebration of Pride Month, Family Karma added a rather suspense-filled episode when Amrit has to come clean about his preferences in front of his aged grandma.</p><p>She was a lady who was older than them, getting first-hand experience with the traditions she had to withhold. Amrit did not want to disappoint her but did not want to keep her in the dark.</p><p>His parents sat at adjacent sofas, ready to do damage control if her reaction got out of her hand.</p><p>Finally, the elder sat down and asked him what was the fuss.</p><p>Despite his nervousness, he calmly explained that he was very ‘different’ in comparison to her other grandchildren. After beating around the bush, he finally told her he liked men and told him about Nicholas, the man he loved.</p><p>Initially, observers saw her shocked expression as she outright told him she was unhappy about the news. His parents swooped him and talked about his happiness as the granny melted and gave in to his requests.</p><p>She came around and gave the couple her blessing and told him that she’s happy if he was happy.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-attorney-amrit-kapai-net-worth-is-200000></span>4.
