Recommended Videos In 2020, Chrystul Kizer of Kenosha, Wisconsin, accused of killing Randall P. Volar III, was released from custody after several community groups raised her bail. Volar was suspected of sexually trafficking and abusing Kizer, a teenager, when Volar died, and two years later, it seemed Kizer’s charges might be dropped.
A judge told Kizer, however, that she could not commit any other crimes as a condition of her 2020 release."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
