Survivor's latest victim Greg &#34;Tarzan&#34; Smith says he acted &#34;nutty&#34; on the show to make himself seem unthreatening to his fellow tribe mates.
Tarzan, a plastic surgeon from Houston, became the last man eliminated from Survivor after failing to split the show's all-girl alliance.
Five women are left in the running for the show's US$1 million prize: Kim, Sabrina, Chelsea, Christina and Alicia."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
