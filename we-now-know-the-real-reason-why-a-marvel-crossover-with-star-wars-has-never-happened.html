Except now we know what happened to prevent a touted MCU/Star Wars crossover from taking flight. Or, more accurately, we know who happened to prevent such a crossover.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>What If…? director Bryan Andrews caused a stir when he confirmed, during an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Moovy</a>, that the animated anthology series could have included a full-on crossover episode with the Star Wars universe. The problem? Marvel Studios prez Kevin Feige hated the idea.</p><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>“I&nbsp;think Kevin [Feige] really doesn’t want to cross certain streams. But we did pitch… We actually had a Star Wars/Marvel crossover,” Andrew admitted. “So I think it’s absolutely doable. I just don’t know if [Feige] wants to cross those streams, but it’s really funny. Once you get to the realization of why, you go: ‘Oh, that… oh, right!’ It totally makes sense. It won’t rain on anyone’s parade. But it was just a love letter to old-school Star Wars. And it was great. And I don’t know if we’ll ever be able to do it. But we have thought about that stuff.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/what-if-season-2-finale-watcher-captain-carter-1-1.jpg><p data-characters=608 data-current-count=908 data-injectable=true>This isn’t actually the first time we’ve heard about this shocking scenario. Back when season 1 released in August 2021, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showrunner A.C. Bradley</a> gave her perspective on Feige’s steadfast refusal to do as the Ghostbusters did and cross the streams. “I was kinda notorious for trying to get a Star Wars character involved,” Bradley recalled. “We did try at one point but it’s kind of like ‘Play with the sandbox that you were given. We gave you the entire MCU, run with that.’ I was like, okay, but still, Luke Skywalker would be an amazing Avenger.”</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>In many ways, it’s curious that Feige has zero interest in launching a Marvel/Star Wars crossover. He’s a known Lucasfilm fan, for one, even being attached to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">produce a Star Wars movie for a time</a>. And the MCU itself is crossover central. And yet Feige’s main mantra is to always follow the comics, and there’s never been a major Marvel/Star Wars crossover on the page — despite Marvel having the license to make Star Wars comics. So if it’s a no-no for Marvel Comics, that’s probably why it’s a no-no for Feige as well.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>With Feige seemingly set to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">remain in the top seat for the foreseeable future</a>, we don’t see the moratorium on Marvel/Star Wars shenanigans ending anytime soon, so this one will likely remain a fascinating What If…? what-if.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorp5lnqTEbrfNqK5mrJiaerOxwKVkq52RqLyvedahsGaZXaKus8LEpWScqp%2BowLDCxKtksKGknXq0wMCrZLCZoqh6qa3SZqWerpWneqmtz6mcp52UZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./uncharted-movie-review-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Uncharted movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2022)</span></a>
