Alex has a wife and two kids.</p><p>“It’s shocking; his riding ability was top-notch,” Prairie Meadows assistant racing secretary Chad Keller said. “It’s unfortunate, whatever he was dealing with at his passing.</p><p>Hopefully, the family will be able to find closure through this difficult time. Prairie Meadows is shocked and very saddened to hear we have lost Alex; he was an excellent rider and will be sorely missed.”</p><p>On May 25, 2022, at Canterbury Park, Alex Canchari rode Tonka Warrior to triumph in the day’s final race, a maiden special weight, marking his 1,000th career winner. While this triumph was achieved in front of his home crowd, he felt a special connection to them and made sure to let them know how much they meant to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alex-Canchari.jpg><p>“This is the place I spent my formative years.

I’m very heartbroken; he is someone I have known for a very long time, and before he was riding, he used to rub horses in Chicago when I was riding there,” jockey Florent Geroux, a friend of the deceased rider, said.</p><p>“Through the years, we always kept in contact. Wherever I rode, we used to try to meet up and do things together. If I won a big race, Alex was always the first to text and congratulate me, and I did the same for him. I don’t know what went wrong in his personal life, but I feel very sad for his wife, family, and friends.”</p><p>Ashley Canchari the rider’s sister has set up a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GoFundMe</a> to collect money for the family.</p><p>If you want to be the first to know about breaking news, follow us on <a href=# rel=noopener>Twitter</a>.
