"If [Lucas] said that, number one, we are paid much, much, much, much, much less than the Housewives, which is crazy because it's Bravo," she said. "It's still a big network. There's still a big production company behind it. They've got the money."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmtka313e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5wZ6jqK9dmbKkt4ydprCmXaq7pbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./johnnys-place-taxisco-guatemala.html><span>←</span><span>Johnnys Place, Taxisco, Guatemala</span></a>
