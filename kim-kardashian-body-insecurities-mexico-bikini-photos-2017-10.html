Before leaving the car,&nbsp;Kim has her dress blow-dried to get rid of any creases, although it&nbsp;winds up&nbsp;blowing&nbsp;a fuse.</p><p>Kim&nbsp;repeatedly says that she feels like she is "going to throw up" before walking the red carpet, and admits that the bikini photos had made her feel more self-conscious. "You know what it was, honestly, that Mexico trip really f----- me up,"&nbsp;she&nbsp;said.</p><p>Even after&nbsp;the Met Gala, though, Kim&nbsp;still seems to be worried about being in the spotlight. Although she thought she would be able to "cover up" the tabloid headlines&nbsp;about her bikini photos with her Met Gala appearance, Kim finds that people are still talking about her bikini photos. "When will they stop for this story?" she asks, adding that "They [the media] won't let it down."</p><p>She added: "You definitely get a thick skin once you have been through it a lot, but pictures keep coming out every day and they won't let it go."</p>—Yahoo Lifestyle (@yahoolifestyle) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 21, 2017</a><p>Kim's sisters were concerned about her body insecurities,&nbsp;after she&nbsp;asked Kourtney if she looked "skinnier," and said she had been trying to do extra workouts. Kim also talked about how she was photographed by paparazzi while she was at a party&nbsp;hosted by&nbsp;Chrissy Teigen, and said that she was squinting in the photo and looked about "80" in the photos.</p><p>Khloe, who has opened up about struggling with her own body insecurities in the past, was&nbsp;especially worried about her sister.</p><p>"Kim looked absolutely amazing at the Met ball and even though I'd hope those pictures would give her another surge of confidence&nbsp;[...]&nbsp;it seems like the Mexico pictures are never-ending,"&nbsp;she said,&nbsp;comparing the&nbsp;backlash to Kim's bikini photos to how she was "mocked" in the wake of the Paris robbery. "Having these photos come out, now everyone has another reason to ridicule her and mock her," she added.</p><p>Later, Khloe said that "one of the best things&nbsp;[Kim] did for herself after the Paris robbery was detach herself from social media," and decided that she and Kourtney should&nbsp;intervene&nbsp;as she said that "Kim is not normally this insecure."</p><p>The sisters&nbsp;devised a plan&nbsp;to delete certain social media and news apps, including TMZ and Daily Mail apps, from&nbsp;Kim's phone. "If she didn't have access to social media, or stopped looking at the blogs, I think that she would start to feel better," Kourtney said.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>On last week's episode of "KUWTK," Kim flipped over paparazzi photos of her wearing a bikini. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# rel=nofollow class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link>Screenshot via E!</a></span></span></figure><p>Later in the episode, Kourtney asked Kim if she could use her phone, while Khloe distracted Kim by having her help&nbsp;sort through her closet.&nbsp;Once she got back to her phone,&nbsp;Kim wasn't&nbsp;impressed&nbsp;to find that&nbsp;Kourtney had deleted some of her apps.</p><p>"I'm not, like, a lunatic," Kim&nbsp;said, when&nbsp;her sisters explained&nbsp;that they were just trying to "eliminate negativity" and help her "live her life" without being affected by headlines about her.</p><p>"I do understand that you guys were just trying to help me," Kim said.&nbsp;"I don't need this negativity in my life." She ultimately agreed to see how she&nbsp;would feel after two days of&nbsp;having her apps blocked, and&nbsp;not looking at any news about herself.</p><p>Hopefully, that&nbsp;worked — but we'll probably have to wait until the next episode to find out.</p><p><strong>Want more?
