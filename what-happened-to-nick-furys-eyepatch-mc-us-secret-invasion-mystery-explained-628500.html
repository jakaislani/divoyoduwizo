MCU's 'Secret Invasion' mystery explained</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: ‘<a href=# rel>Secret Invasion</a>’, the highly anticipated upcoming spy-thriller miniseries in the <a href=# rel>Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> (MCU), is poised to deliver a captivating blend of deception and thrilling action. The show boasts an impressive ensemble cast, including Emilia Clarke from ‘<a href=# rel>Game of Thrones</a>’ and Samuel L Jackson, known for his iconic portrayal of the Marvel character Nick Fury. In an intriguing twist, the recently released trailer of the miniseries has left fans astonished as it unveils a surprising absence of Fury’s trademark eyepatch in his new spin-off.</p><p>After keeping their fans waiting, Marvel Studios finally dropped the latest trailer for 'Secret Invasion', which reveals intriguing revelations. The preview confirms Samuel L Jackson in the lead role as Nick Fury and gives a glimpse of him sporting two looks: one with his trademark eyepatch and one where it curiously goes missing. As Phase 5 unfolds, Fury returns to Earth to investigate a Skrull uprising masterminded by Gravik, portrayed by Kingsley Ben-Adir. Joining Fury on this mission is his ally from 'Captain Marvel', Talos, played by Ben Mendelsohn. 'Secret Invasion' marks Samuel L Jackson's debut as a main character in the MCU, offering an ideal opportunity to shed light on the enigmatic aspects of Fury's covert persona, including the mystery behind his missing eyepatch.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>What is Charlie Cox's net worth? A look at 'Echo' star's private life with wife Samantha Thomas</a></p><p>For the majority of Nick Fury's character arc, he has been seen wearing his eyepatch, a result of his injury caused by a scratch from the Flerken named Goose in 'Captain Marvel'. However, the recent trailers for 'Secret Invasion' hint at Fury's eye being healed, as he no longer wears the eyepatch and openly displays the injury to his left eye to the world.</p><h2 class=split>‘Secret Invasion’ explains Nick Fury’s eye mystery</h2><p>The intriguing dual appearance of Nick Fury in 'Secret Invasion' opens up several possibilities. Firstly, the miniseries could utilize the distinct looks of Nick Fury to provide clarity to the audience, enabling them to differentiate between the real Nick Fury and Talos. Alternatively, this unusual duo could employ a similar deception as seen in 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' to trick the characters involved in the 'Secret Invasion.' Another speculation is that Fury may not have needed the eyepatch during his time off-world, potentially indicating that he can access SHIELD's systems even if his eyepatch were compromised, as he demonstrated in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier.'</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘Echo’ | Date, plot, cast, director and is the Marvel series worth watching</a></p><p>The first trailer for 'Secret Invasion' concludes with Nick Fury wearing his iconic eyepatch, hinting at a potential new purpose for his eye. It suggests that the eyepatch could serve as a defense mechanism against Skrulls other than Talos attempting to impersonate Fury. Additionally, it is plausible that the eyepatch conceals a crucial element necessary for the rebel Skrulls to accurately replicate Fury's appearance. Regardless, 'Secret Invasion' promises to provide answers as to why Fury never restored his left eye, despite having access to advanced alien technologies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/f8593b2d-f2fc-4159-9afb-8db0998a9c97.jpeg><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who stars in Marvel's 'Echo'?

Jackson revealed the reason behind his character's decision to no longer wear his iconic eye patch. Jackson explained, "The patch is part of who the strong Nick Fury was, so removing the eye patch adds to the character's vulnerability. When you look at him without it, you can see that he's not this perfectly indestructible person." As Fury returns in the upcoming spy thriller, he appears to be out of his depth, lacking his usual steadfast leadership skills. Although Fury's eye patch has been absent before in 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier,' symbolizing the death of his life at SHIELD, this recurring theme could suggest further exploration of Fury's human side in 'Secret Invasion.'</p><p>'Secret Invasion' is set to release on June 21, 2023, on Disney+.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>'Sad but inevitable': Marvel fans upset as Kevin Feige douses last hopes of Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man returning to MCU</a></p><p><a href=#>'Stop making remakes': Internet mocks Disney CEO Bob Iger’s explanation for recent box-office failures including Marvel projects</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iWwW60wKmnnqaVmXq1u4ynoJyjXZvCs8XSZpyynaCWwaS0jKaaZq2jYsCmr9Geq2ahnquutLXOp2SmsaOpsrPFjJ6vqaSRnrumsIxvaXFtYGU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stefania-deriabina-wiki-age-biography-birthday-parents-height-instagram.html><span>←</span><span>Stefania Deriabina Wiki Age, Biography, Birthday, Parents, Height, Instagram</span></a>
