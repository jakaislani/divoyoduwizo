Mayor R. Rex Parris of Lancaster has sent the bereaved family his sympathy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-byron-burkhart-and-alexandria-gentile-reportedly-killed-gor-adamyan><strong>How</strong> <strong>Byron Burkhart and Alexandria Gentile Reportedly Killed Gor Adamyan</strong></h2><p>Around 7.30 p.m. local time on Friday, December 15, the tragic tragedy occurred. Gor Adamyan was traveling to get groceries when his family drove past Sierra Highway and East Avenue J in Lancaster. Gor was riding in the backseat of the vehicle.</p><p>The family’s car was cut off by another driver, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, and they were later pursued.</p><p>After the pursuit began, the motorist approached the family vehicle and started shooting. The toddler was in the backseat of the automobile when the gunshots hit it.</p><p>Gor’s parents hurried him to the hospital right away, but he passed away from his wounds. R. Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, told ABC 7 Los Angeles, “We’re praying for the family. It’s unimaginable that this could have been any of our families. It could have been any of us.”</p><p>Law enforcement officers subsequently identified Alexandria Gentile and Byron Burkhart as the culprits in the automobile. After finding their car again, the police arrested them. According to family spokesman Dr. Miguel S. Coronado, “The Christmas trees, and the presents and the food – all of that is meaningless because they don’t have their child.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-byron-burkhart-allegedly-previously-charged-with-a-gun-related-felony><strong>Byron Burkhart Allegedly Previously Charged With a Gun-related Felony</strong></h2><p>Dr. Miguel S. Coronado further told KTLA on Monday, “The family right now is totally devastated. They’re confused, in and out of awareness… and in disbelief that this happened to their family.”</p><p>Mayor Paris went on to discuss Byron Burkhart and the reasons he shouldn’t be allowed to walk around freely. According to KTLA, Paris said, “This particular suspect was in custody a week ago for a gun-related felony and they had to let him go because of the new bail laws.”</p><p>The new zero-bail policy, which has generated controversy since it was implemented, was another topic covered by the mayor. Many persons who are arrested for non-violent crimes are either cited and released or booked and released under this procedure.</p><p>They’re not kept under bond. Holding such individuals is crucial, according to Mayor Paris, to protect the lives of the defenseless. He added, “What did we expect? Did we really think our children weren’t going to be the victims of this [policy]? Because they are.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunDDx6hkmqqVYq%2B6vs6nZJutoqC1or7TZpinnF2WuabEwKebq6GRYrSmutOio55lo6rAsbHCrapmoZ5iuaJ50aiYnWWilrSmedKhpqismaO0bsDHmqtmo5mhuaawjKCmq2WRma6uxcCnZJqqoprAtbHDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./never-let-me-go-2010.html><span>←</span><span>Never Let Me Go movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2010)</span></a>
