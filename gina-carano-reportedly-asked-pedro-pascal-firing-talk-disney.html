It’s currently unclear if Pascal did as she requested, but it seems unlikely, as Richtman notes that nothing came of it. This follows on from a previous rumor he shared, pointing to <a href=# rel=noopener>Pascal reaching out to Carano</a> prior to her firing and suggesting she tone down her online activity for her own good, which is advice she obviously ignored.</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>This might paint a picture of the two co-stars falling out over all this, then, especially given their extremely divergent political views. However, that really doesn’t seem to be the case. <a href=# rel=noopener>In an interview</a> following her firing, Carano maintained that she has no ill will towards Pascal, describing him as a “sweetheart.” Meanwhile, Pascal has frequently posted support for the Cara Dune actress, though not since Lucasfilm let her go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210308_232216.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210308_232256.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210308_232306.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210308_232241.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20210308_232230.jpg><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>While Carano’s career in mainstream Hollywood <a href=# rel=noopener>appears to be over</a>, at least for the while, Pascal is getting more popular and successful all the time.
