When Calloway escapes police custody, [a detective] joins forces with a no-nonsense female cop to reclaim his prisoner. But is Calloway’s crime-boss father (Cusack) somehow involved in this explosive situation?”</p><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=586 data-injectable=true>The movie was directed by Brian Skiba and executive produced by Andrew Stevens. Check out a photo of everyone together on set from July of last year when the movie was being filmed.
