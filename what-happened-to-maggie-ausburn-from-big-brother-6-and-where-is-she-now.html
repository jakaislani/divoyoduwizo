As all avid fans of Big Brother surely know, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alliances can either hinder players or take them further</a> in the game, so there’s no doubt that leading one is no easy task. But this contestant rose to the challenge, and that paid off in the season 6 finale when she got to take home the big prize.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>Following her time in the Big Brother house, Ausburn left the spotlight and has lived a private life. Naturally, this has led folks to wonder what became of her.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-maggie-ausburn-after-big-brother data-injectable=false>What happened to Maggie Ausburn after Big Brother?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=203 data-current-count=203 data-injectable=false>Ausburn was only the third <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">woman to have won the reality competition show</a>, and after accomplishing that feat, she pretty much disappeared save for a brief appearance in the Big Brother 7 finale audience.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>As time passed, it became increasingly difficult to know what happened to the former houseguest, as she doesn’t have a social media presence. Interviews with her, which are some of the few ways we can keep track of former reality stars, are also nowhere to be found.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>All that said, there are some tidbits of information about Ausburn to be found online. Although scarce, there are some reports that the contestant got married and had three kids – including a pair of twins – and is currently living in Las Vegas. Given this, it’s safe to assume that the prize money was useful. Raising a family can be many things, but cheap isn’t one of them.</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Other than that, we have little else on Ausburn or her life post-show, sadly. Perhaps her family is part of the reason why Ausburn opted for living a quiet life. Or maybe it’s due to the hate that her alliance received. Whatever her reason is, we can only respect her decision to avoid publicity.</p><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=false>While some Big Brother participants later <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">come back to the spotlight on shows like Survivor</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Champion</a>, it’s highly unlikely that we’ll see Ausburn on another reality series. We never know what the future holds, naturally, but it’s more than obvious that she would rather keep to herself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZZ2WtKi1xGaYrquSqr%2BvecWrpqZlkp60bq7RqKuhnaJig26tzZ1ksKCVp7JutdJmqqGdXaO8uHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./september-21-birthday-zodiac-virgo-trendy.html><span>←</span><span>September 21 Zodiac Horoscope Birthday Personality</span></a>
