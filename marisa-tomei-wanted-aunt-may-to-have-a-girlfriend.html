I’ll just- I’ll just like be in a scene and you’ll be over there, and I’ll just be like “hey” y’know? It’ll just be a subtle thing.” But no-one went for it at the time.</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Geeks of Color</a><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>This would be a marked change from the comic books, where May has dated (and married) several people from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Spider-Man’s</a> supporting cast, from J.

So far, there’s only one gay superhero in the universe, in Phastos from Eternals.
